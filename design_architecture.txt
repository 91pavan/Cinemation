Cinemation is really a very simple web application which is more of a clone of Rotten Tomatoes.
Usability : It is a very miniature movie search engine which takes in a search request and gives all the relevant details of that movie.

Also, it gives a hint of which movies are currently doing very good at the Box Office.

Design / Architecture : Not many components involved. The main is the search engine which is written in PHP. 
I use the Rotten Tomato API and contact the server with the movie name the user searches for.

I parse the response and show the result in a very nice format which is readable.


My application is hosted on AppFog. AppFog is a public cloud PaaS.
It can handle 100 requests per second and has scalable architecture with built-in caching and load balancing.
